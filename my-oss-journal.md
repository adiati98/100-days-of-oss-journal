  - There's no proper docs about how to update the monthly challenges except the way to navigate to the file that needs to be updated. So I had to take a look at previous issues and pull requests. Time for updating the docs 😄!

#### How to create issues and pull requests templates on GitHub

- **Resources**:
  - [About issue and pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
  - [Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

### ✨ Self-Contribution

#### [adiati98 / 100-days-of-oss-journal](https://github.com/adiati98/100-days-of-oss-journal)

- **Description**: My goal is to have an issue and a pull request template in this repository.
- **Tasks completed**:

  - Created a pull request template — [pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md).
- **Challenges faced**:
  - It's more of a curiosity than a challenge. I read that we can have multiple PR templates that we can store in the `.github` folder. But when I tried, not any of them show in the PR form. It might needs the query parameters, but I couldn't find any resources on how to do it yet.
- **Resources used**:
  - [Using query parameters to create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)

### ✨ Self-Contribution

#### [Open Sauced Highlights](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/)

- **Description**: My goal is to add PR highlights to Open Sauced Insights.
- **Tasks completed**:
  - Created [highlights](https://insights.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/highlights) of my (kind of) big PRs.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - I added the highlights per repo because it was easier that way. I thought I could edit and fix the date later from the calendar icon available so I can reorder the highlights based on the date of creation. But changing the date doesn't change the order 😕. I might create an issue if I don't see any issue or PR mentioning this.

#### [open-sauced / insights](https://github.com/open-sauced/insights)

- **Challenges faced**:

  - There are hunderds of issues and PRs. I tried to search what I'm looking for with the keywords "order", "sort", and "date", and I couldn't find anything related to what I search for. I hope I didn't make duplicate issue 😅. This is one of the reasons I often feel hesitate to create an issue on a repo that I'm not familiar with 😣. But, hey, I'm learning 😄.
