- **Challenges faced**:
  - There's no proper docs about how to update the monthly challenges except the way to navigate to the file that needs to be updated. So I had to take a look at previous issues and pull requests. Time for updating the docs 😄!

- **Challenges faced**:
  - It's more of a curiosity than a challenge. I read that we can have multiple PR templates that we can store in the `.github` folder. But when I tried, not any of them show in the PR form. It might needs the query parameters, but I couldn't find any resources on how to do it yet.

  - I added the highlights per repo because it was easier that way. I thought I could edit and fix the date later from the calendar icon available so I can reorder the highlights based on the date of creation. But changing the date doesn't change the order 😕. I might create an issue if I don't see any issue or PR mentioning this.

  - There are hunderds of issues and PRs. I tried to search what I'm looking for with the keywords "order", "sort", and "date", and I couldn't find anything related to what I search for. I hope I didn't make duplicate issue 😅. This is one of the reasons I often feel hesitate to create an issue on a repo that I'm not familiar with 😣. But, hey, I'm learning 😄.
