#### [Open Sauced — 100-days-of-oss-template](https://github.com/open-sauced/100-days-of-oss-template)

- **Description**: My goal for today is to start working on updating the README. My ideas:
  - Add the code examples for git commands.
  - Add the steps for users to work on their progress using the template in the `journal.md`.
  - Add the steps to update the `table-of-contents.md`.
  - Add a paragraph including a link to the Markdown docs for folks who are not familiar with Markdown.
- **Tasks completed**:
  - Cloned the template repo, made it private, and use it as a draft and a playground to try things out because I can't live preview the format of markdown locally.
  - Added code examples for git commands.
  - Added steps for users to work on their progress and to use the `journal.md` template in the "Getting Started" section.
  - Added steps to update the `table-of-contents.md` in the "Tips for making the most out of #100DaysOfOSS" section.
